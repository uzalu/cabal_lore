# Cabal Lore

Welcome to the Golden Age Cabal, a group of like-minded free-thinkers in favour of meritocratic civilisation, seeking to help bring about a Golden Age.

This community was established in 2016. No matter where how often we're censored, the people of Cabal will rise again.

During our history we have accrued a lot of lore - notable events and stories (some true, some apocryphal) which have become part of our culture.
This repository is intended to record our lore, and allow members to submit changes to how the lore is recorded.
